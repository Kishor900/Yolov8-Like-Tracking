# üåü Introduction

Welcome to my advanced computer vision project! Here, I leverage the power of YOLOv8, the latest in the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, combined with ZeroMQ, to create a dynamic real-time object tracking and logging system.

# üìñ About the Project

In this project, I integrate the cutting-edge YOLOv8 model for object detection with a robust ZeroMQ messaging framework. This setup is ideal for scenarios that demand efficient and real-time processing such as surveillance systems, traffic monitoring, or advanced retail analytics.

# üîß Installation

To start using this project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# üöÄ Inferencing

Harness the capabilities of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. Make sure to adjust the `config.json` file to meet your specific requirements. For more information about YOLOv8 and Ultralytics, visit [their GitHub page](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

# üñ•Ô∏è Server Side (`main.py`)

The server script is responsible for real-time video processing:

```python
# Execute the server script
python main.py
```

It captures video frames, processes them for object detection, and sends the relevant data to the client for logging purposes.

# üì° Client Side (`receiver.py`)

The client script handles data logging:

```python
# Start the client script
python receiver.py
```

It listens for incoming messages from the server and diligently logs each event into `crossing_log.csv`.

# ‚å® Key Instructions

- `Pause/Resume Processing Key (default: 'g' and 's')`: Pauses and resumes the video processing. Press 'g' to pause the live video feed. While paused, you can draw lines on the frame. Press 's' to resume processing with the drawn lines.
- `Start/Stop Recording Key (default: 'k' and 'l')`: Starts and stops the video recording. Press 'k' to begin recording the video stream and 'l' to stop it. The recorded video is saved as `rec_inf.mp4`.
- `Exit Application Key (default: 'q')`: Quits the application. Ensure to stop recording before exiting.
- `Drawing Mode`: Activated when the processing is paused. Click and drag the mouse on the video window to draw lines. These lines can be used for tracking or other purposes in the video feed.

Remember to adapt these keys as per your `config.json` settings or personal preferences. The default key assignments are based on typical usage but can be customized to fit your workflow.


# ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project is a testament to the amazing potential of combining advanced computer vision techniques with efficient data communication systems. It's versatile and can be adapted to a variety of real-time data processing and analytics applications.
