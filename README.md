# 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to our cutting-edge computer vision project, where we harness the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and ZeroMQ for real-time object tracking and logging!

# 📖 About the Project

This project integrates YOLO for object detection with a ZeroMQ messaging system to create a robust server-client model for real-time video processing and logging. It's perfect for applications requiring efficient data processing and recording, such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, or retail analytics.

# 🔧 Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 🚀 Inferencing

Utilize the power of YOLO for real-time object detection. Modify `config.json` to tailor the model to your specific needs.

# 🖥️ Server Side (`main.py`)

The server performs real-time video analysis:

```python
# Run the server script
python main.py
```

This script captures video, detects objects, and sends data to the client for logging.

# 📡 Client Side (`receiver.py`)

The client receives and logs data:

```python
# Run the client script
python receiver.py
```

This script listens for messages from the server and logs them into `crossing_log.csv`.

# ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a powerful combination of computer vision and messaging frameworks for real-time data processing and logging. It's highly adaptable for various use-cases in real-time analytics.
